<h1>Test HTML Page</h1>

<p>This HTML page is used to test that nofollow links have been inserted correctly.</p>

<p>It contains a number of links. Here's one <a href="/about">without a hostname</a>. Here is 
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk">an external one</a>, with no rel attribute. Here is one that
<a href="http://www.google.com" rel="me">already has a rel attribute</a>, which should be preserved.
And here is one that <a href="http://php.net" rel="nofollow">already includes nofollow</a>, which must not
be repeated.</p>

<p>Finally, here is a list of links we will skip, depending on what the current domain is:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://example.com/some-page">Example one</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://example.org/another-page">Example one</a></li>
</ul>
